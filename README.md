# Vehicle Dashboard with ADAS and AI Features

This repository documents a school project for designing a vehicle dashboard system that integrates `ADAS` (Advanced Driver Assistance System) features, real-time sensor data, and AI-based speed limitation based on detected road signs.

## Overview

The project uses multiple microcontrollers to implement a reliable communication and control system for a vehicle dashboard. It also incorporates computer vision to detect speed limits and enforce safe driving decisions in real-time.

## System Architecture

The system consists of:

- **ESP32 (Dashboard)**: Hosts the dashboard UI and communicates with the AI detection system.
- **ESP32 (Intermediate)**: Acts as a central controller between the Arduino, Dashboard ESP32, and STM32.
- **Arduino Nano**: Handles driver inputs and sensors (touch, angle, ...).
- **STM32 Nucleo-F446RE**: Final controller for motor control and safety enforcement.
- **Python Script**: Performs road sign detection and sends speed data via serial.

## Contents

- **Datasheets**: Key datasheets and reference manuals of the components used.
- **Circuit Diagram**: Overview of the system architecture, flow diagrams, and protocol mapping.
- **Main Firmware**:
  - `Arduino_Sensors_Data.ino`: Reads touch sensors, angle, and driver speed input.
  - `ESP32_intermediate.ino`: Receives data from Arduino and the ESP32 Dashboard, sends command data to the STM32.
  - `ESP32_Car_Dashboard.ino`: Hosts dashboard server, displays environment info, and receives data from the Python script.
  - `htmlPage.h`: HTML page served by the ESP32 Web Server.
  - `STM32_Motors_Control/`: STM32 code to handle final motor control decisions.
- **AI Detection**:
  - `main.py`: Python code that detects speed limits from road signs using AI.
- **Tests**: Example sketches to verify communication protocols.

## Communication Protocols Used

Each microcontroller communicates using a different protocol:

- **UART**: Between ESP32 Dashboard and Python AI script.
- **HTTP**: Used by the ESP32 Dashboard to serve the web-based UI.
- **CAN**: Between the two ESP32 microcontrollers.
- **I2C**: Between ESP32 Intermediate and STM32.
- **SPI**: Between Arduino Nano and ESP32 Intermediate.
- **I2C**: For sensor connections on Arduino (if needed).

## AI-Based Speed Limitation

The AI system uses a camera and a Python script to:

- Detect road sign images (speed limits),
- Parse and extract the speed limit,
- Send the max allowed speed to ESP32.

The ESP32 then compares the detected speed to the userâ€™s speed input and sends the **minimum of both** to STM32 for enforcement.

## Dashboard UI

A simple, responsive dashboard is served by the ESP32. It shows:

- Detected speed limit,
- Driver input speed,
- Final allowed speed,
- Real-time sensor data (tilt/roll, touch interaction, ...),
- Speedometer with a rotating needle for visualizing actual speed dynamically.
